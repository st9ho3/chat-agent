/**
 * API route for uploading a file to Vercel Blob storage.
 * This route handles POST requests with a file body. It requires a `filename`
 * to be provided as a URL search parameter. The file is uploaded to Vercel Blob
 * with public access and a random suffix is added to the filename to prevent
 * naming conflicts. The function returns the details of the uploaded blob
 * in a JSON response. An error is returned if the `filename` or request body
 * is missing.
